A comprehensive MLOps project implementing a CI/CD pipeline for deploying a sentence completion model using GPT-2 from Hugging Face, leveraging Azure and Docker for scalable, production-ready NLP solutions.

<!--more-->

**Project Highlights:**
- **Develop and fine-tune a GPT-2 model** for sentence completion tasks using Hugging Face Transformers.
- **Containerize the application** with Docker for consistent deployment environments.
- **Automate CI/CD workflows** to streamline building, testing, and deploying models using GitHub Actions.
- **Integrate with Azure Container Registry (ACR)** for secure and scalable image management.
- **Monitor and manage model deployments** with best practices from the MLOps lifecycle.
- **Reusable, modular codebase** for rapid iteration and extensibility in NLP projects.
- Utilizes modern Python NLP and DevOps tools: `transformers`, `docker`, `azure`, and `GitHub Actions`.
