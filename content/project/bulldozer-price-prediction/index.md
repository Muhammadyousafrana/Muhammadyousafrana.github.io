**Project Highlights:**
- **Analyze and clean bulldozer sales data** for model training and evaluation.
- **Feature engineering and preprocessing** to extract meaningful insights from raw data.
- **Build and tune regression models** (including Random Forests) to predict sale prices.
- **Visualize data distributions and model performance** with plots generated in Jupyter Notebook.
- **End-to-end reproducible workflow**: from data loading to final predictions and submission.
- Uses widely adopted Python data science libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`.
