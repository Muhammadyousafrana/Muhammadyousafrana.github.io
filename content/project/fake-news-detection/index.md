**Key Features:**
- 🧹 **Debiased the dataset** to reduce skew and ensure fair model performance
- 🔍 Built a classic **ML pipeline** using `TfidfVectorizer` and `MultinomialNB` for efficient fake news classification
- 🧠 Implemented a **CNN-based NLP model** for deeper context understanding and semantic pattern learning
- 🔄 Compared performance between traditional and deep learning methods to ensure robustness
- 📊 Visualized metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix for model evaluation

**Technologies Used:**
- Scikit-learn (for pipeline, TF-IDF, Naive Bayes)
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (for CNN)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data preprocessing & visualization)
