        I'm deeply passionate about AI and its applications in biomedical informatics. My current research focuses on improving contextual understanding in sentence classification of medical abstracts using transformer-based models.

        I've recently published a paper that integrates BERT embeddings, character-level BiLSTM processing, and abstract structure features to outperform prior models on the PubMed 20k dataset.
